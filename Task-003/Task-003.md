# Task 3

Create a simple resume with two pages:

1. Professional Page
2. About Me Page

The resources are available in the `resources` folder. The directory structure is expected to be similar (*no need* to have exact folder / file names):

```dart
Task-003
├── sol-003a.html
├── sol-003b.html
└── images
    ├── image-1.png
    ├── image-2.png
    ├── ...
    .
    .
    └── image-n.png
```
