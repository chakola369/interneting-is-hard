		<h1>Links</h1>
		<p>This example is about links and <a href='images.html'>images</a>.</p>
		<p>This particular paste is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>
		<ul>
			<!-- Add <li> elements here -->
			
			<li>Absolute links, like to <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML' target='_blank'>Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web developers.</li>
			
			<!--Itâ€™s usually a better idea to reserve absolute links only for directing users to a different website.-->

			<li>Relative links, like to our <a href='misc/extras.html'>extras page</a>.</li>

			<!-- This won't work for our local HTML files -->
			<li>Root-relative links, like to the <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website, but those aren't useful to us right now.</li>

			<!--The target attribute has a few pre-defined values that carry special meaning for web browsers, but the most common one is _blank, which specifies a new tab or window.-->
		</ul>
